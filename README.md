Adventures in Northern Minnesota

>  Coming soon! Johnson Family Cabin

## Currently

Two acres of beautiful forest, adjoining Bear Head State Park. 

Halfway between Tower and Ely.

Lake shore access to Eagles Nest Lake 2 (for twins!)

Less than five hours from White Bear Lake, on the way into Ely. 

## Coming Soon

Working with our builder, Joe Gerzin, to build a window-front chalet, overlooking the land. 

Lower has 2-bedrooms, 2-full baths: "Little Finland" and "Da Norge" offer a spacious retreat room and a jumping off spot to adventures.

Look-out loft holds "Camp Connie" a great place for the younguns to sleep out - or pitch a tent. 

Hall Hall takes you from the attached garage into wall of windows in the front. 



## Explore!

Come see:

- The Twins - two stately pines overlooking the adventures, with their beloved partners nearby
- Lilly's Lookout - an expansive view of the adventure land
- Eden's Edge - an exciting rocky wall for climbing and fossil exploration
- Nora's Nook - a secret, special spot in the forest 
- Mount Emmett - a high spot for exploration
- Isla Vista (baby!) - the perfect view to overlook the land
- Isla's Inlet - a nice place to drop your kayak and safely explore the gentle increase to deeper waters
- Madelyn Lane - a scenic drive on the way to the lake
- Marilyn's Meditation Meadow - a quiet place for reflection and gratitude
- Bruce's Backwoods - kept in the original state, home for wildlife of all species

Ride the rocket!

- We'll need some help to work the land. Come ride The Rocket!

Water Access

- Until we tame the land, come drop in kayaks, canoes, and more at the convenient boat access (just over the hill and though the woods - or a short drive) at Bear Head Lake State Park Public Access.
