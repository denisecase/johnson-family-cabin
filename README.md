# Johnson Family Cabin

> Adventures in Northern Minnesota

## Currently

Two acres of beautiful forest, adjoining [Bear Head Lake State Park](https://goo.gl/maps/RFne5uV7ig8XQSCZ6). 

Halfway [between Tower and Ely](images/maps/Maps-MN-IronRange-Tower-Ely.PNG).

Lake shore access to Eagles Nest Lake 2 (two for twins!)

Less than five hours from White Bear Lake, on the way into Ely. 

## Coming Soon

Working with the builder, [Joe Gerzin](https://www.elywoodwizardsllc.com/), to build a window-front chalet, overlooking the land. 

Lower level has [2-bedrooms, 2-full baths](images/Chalet%20mod%204.jpg). Both bedrooms, "Little Finland" and "Da Norge", offer a nice jumping off spot to adventures.

Look-out loft holds carpeted "Camp Connie" - a great place for the younguns to sleep out - or pitch a tent. 

Hall Hall takes you through the home to the open gathering area up front. 

## Explore!

Come see:

- The Twins - tall twin pines overlooking the adventures, with their beloved partners nearby
- Lilly's Lookout - an expansive view of the adventure land
- Eden's Edge - an exciting rocky wall for climbing and fossil exploration
- Nora's Nook - a secret, special spot in the forest 
- Mount Emmett - a high spot for exploration
- Isla Vista (baby!) - the perfect view to overlook the land
- Isla's Inlet - a nice place to drop your kayak and safely explore the gentle increase to deeper waters
- Madelyn Lane - a scenic drive on the way to the lake
- Marilyn's Meditation Meadow - a quiet place for reflection and gratitude
- Bruce's Backwoods - kept in the original state, home for wildlife of all species
- The Brothers - two stately pines, with family pines nearby 

Ride the rocket!

- We'll need some help to work the land. Come ride The Rocket!

Water Access

- Until we tame the land, come drop in kayaks, canoes, and more at the convenient boat access (just over the hill and though the woods - or a short drive) at Bear Head Lake State Park Public Access.

Eagle Viewing

- Lots of [bald eagles in next door Bear Head State Park](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/birds/eagles/summer_map.html)!
