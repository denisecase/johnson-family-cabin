## Coming Soon

Working with the builder, [Joe Gerzin](https://www.elywoodwizardsllc.com/), to build a window-front chalet, overlooking the land. 

Lower level has [2-bedrooms, 2-full baths](images/Chalet%20mod%204.jpg). Both bedrooms, "Little Finland" and "Da Norge", offer a nice jumping off spot to adventures.

Look-out loft holds carpeted "Camp Connie" - a great place for the younguns to sleep out, pitch tents, read, and plan adventures. 

Hall Hall takes you through the home to the open gathering area up front.

- Until we tame the land, come drop in kayaks, canoes, and more at the convenient boat access (just over the hill and though the woods - or a short drive) at Bear Head Lake State Park Public Access.

- Shore access provides [gentle increase out to a max depth of 36'](images/EaglesNestLake2-depth-map.PNG).
